The routing shown on most maps continues Route 120 north on Route 122 for about one block, then heading southwest on Manville Hill Road to Route 126 , where it travels north with Route 126 to Sayles Hill Road, then southwest on Sayles Hill Road to Route 146 . Though Route 120 does not extend past Route 122 , a state-maintained road continues past an interchange with Route 99 to Route 146 . References 1 2 "Route 120" (Map). Google Maps .
