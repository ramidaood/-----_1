It has not been carried by a Democrat for President since Lyndon Johnson 's 1964 landslide victory . The last time it backed a Democrat for Governor was in 1936 when conservative Democrat Clarence D. Martin swept every county in the state and the last Democratic Senator was "Scoop" Jackson , who carried the county in five consecutive county sweeps (the last in 1982 ). Education Schools School districts including parts of the county are: Dayton School District Pomeroy School District Prescott School District Starbuck School District Waitsburg School District Library The Columbia County Rural Library District operates a library in Dayton. People living in Dayton are in the library's taxation base, but not in the library's voting base; the voting area for the library only consists of unincorporated areas . The library was established in 1919 as a small reading room while a women's civics club fundraised for a permanent building. The raised funds were transferred to the Dayton city government in 1935 and used to construct a public library in 1937 using New Deal funding; the building was later expanded in 1947. It is the only public library in Columbia County. A November 2023 ballot measure proposes to close the rural library district, and therefore the library itself, entirely due to the placement and availability of children's books on racial issues and LGBT topics. The library collection would be received by the Washington State Library if the rural library district is dissolved.
